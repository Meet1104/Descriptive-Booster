## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a socio-economic household dataset to:
- Understand income distribution
- Identify demographic patterns
- Apply descriptive statistical techniques
- Visualize income trends across education and location

This project focuses on **central tendency**, **dispersion**, **distribution shape**, **skewness**, and **kurtosis**.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Urban households generally earn more than rural households  
- Higher education levels are associated with higher income  
- Income distribution is **positively skewed**  
- Income inequality is clearly visible  
- Rural households tend to have larger family sizes
